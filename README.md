# grbl-cnc32

Simple controller for my RS-CNC32, this Grbl controller runs on a ESP32.

Swagger here : https://yroffin.github.io/grbl-cnc32/swagger-ui

Work based on https://github.com/mstrens/grbl_controller_esp32.

Thanks to https://github.com/mstrens for his initial work.

# Hardware and software

## Hardware

To implement this project you need:
- an ESP32 development board and
- a display module combining 3 components:
  - a touch screen 320 X 240 a ILI9341 (display controller),
  - a XPT2046 (control the touch panel) and
  - a SD card support
  
Note: this configuration uses the ILI9341 with 4 wires (CLK, MOSI, MISO and CD).

Currently, this project works only with a TFT having a ILI9341 chip, a resolution of 320X240 and XPT2046 chip for the touch screen. If you are using another display, you should change the code yourself.

## Software

This project compiles in Arduino IDE but it requires:
- to add in Arduino IDE the software that support ESP32. The process is explained e.g. in this link
	https://randomnerdtutorials.com/installing-the-esp32-board-in-arduino-ide-windows-instructions/
 
Take care that if you do not use my configuration, you can have:
-  to edit the file User_setup.h included in the TFT_eSPI_ms folder.
   This file specify the type of display controller and the pins being used by the SPI, the display and the touch screen chip select.
-  to edit the file config.h from this project in order to specify some pins being used (e.g. the chip select for the SD card reader)
  
Note: the pins used for the SPI signals (MOSI, MISO, SCLK) are currently hardcoded.
Please note that many ESP32 pins are reserved and can't ne used (reserved for bootup, for internal flash, input only,...).
See doc on ESP for more details.
